Feature 				Time Complexity     		Space Complexity

classify_file				O(n) => no of file		O(n) => no of file 


search file 				2*O(m*n)  			O(m)
					m = no of classification 
					n = no of file inside file_type


large file 				O(1)				O(n) => no of large file

delete_file_type			2*(O(m)) 			O(1)
					m = no of classification

delete_name				O(m*n) + O(k)			O(k)
					k = no of same file

duplicate
    --> delete dolder			O(1) 				O(1)

    --> compress 			O(m*n)				O(m*n)

add file 				O(m*n)				O(1)

infrequently accessed files		O(n)				O(k)
									k = no files which are not accessed upto threshold
